# Flutter-smart-access-manager
End of study IoT projcet for bachelor degree internship for the year 2019

The work presented in this internship is part of the Design and implementation of an IoT system for access management for vehicles. In a first part, we detected the presence of a vehicle in front of the local and captured the registration number. In a second part, we made a connection between the Raspberry pi 3 card and the database to verify the authorization of this vehicle. In a third part, we developed a cross-platform Flutter application that allows the user to manage access, view vehicle history and receive notifications in some cases.
